## Description

Graph Visualizer is an interactive tool developed to help visualize and analyze graph algorithms. It supports various functionalities including Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), shortest path calculation, and topological sorting. The application allows for real-time graph analysis, showcasing traversal paths, shortest paths, and topological orders with distinct visual differentiation.

## Features

- **Graph Visualization**: Visualize nodes and edges in a customizable layout.
- **Traversal Algorithms**: Execute BFS and DFS to explore the graph.
- **Shortest Path**: Calculate and display the shortest path between two nodes.
- **Topological Sort**: Perform topological sorting on the graph.
- **Error Handling**: Includes input validation to ensure accurate graph representation.

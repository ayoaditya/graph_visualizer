# Graph Visualizer

## Description

Graph Visualizer is an interactive tool developed to help visualize and analyze graph algorithms. It supports various functionalities including Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), shortest path calculation, and topological sorting. The application allows for real-time graph analysis, showcasing traversal paths, shortest paths, and topological orders with distinct visual differentiation.

## Features

- **Graph Visualization**: Visualize nodes and edges in a customizable layout.
- **Traversal Algorithms**: Execute BFS and DFS to explore the graph.
- **Shortest Path**: Calculate and display the shortest path between two nodes.
- **Topological Sort**: Perform topological sorting on the graph.
- **Error Handling**: Includes input validation to ensure accurate graph representation.

## Live Demo

## Installation

**Clone the repository**
   git clone https://github.com/ayoaditya/graph_visualizer


## Usage

1. **Enter Graph Data**: Provide nodes and edges in the input section (e.g., `1 2\n2 3`).
2. **Select Algorithm**: Choose from BFS, DFS, Shortest Path, Topological Sort or Normal Visualization.
3. **Submit Graph**: Click the "Submit" button to visualize the graph.
4. **Find Shortest Path**: Enter source and destination nodes and click "Find Shortest Path" to get the shortest path.
5. **Export Graph**: Click "Export Graph" to download the current graph visualization as an image.

## Components

- **TopologicalSort**: Handles topological sorting of the graph.
- **ProcessGraphInput**: Processes and validates graph input.
- **ShortestPath**: Calculates the shortest path between nodes.
- **DfsTraversal**: Executes Depth-First Search.
- **BfsTraversal**: Executes Breadth-First Search.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **reagraph**: For rendering the graph and its layouts.
- **react-toastify**: For displaying error messages.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
